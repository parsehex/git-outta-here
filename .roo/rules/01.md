# Git Outta Here - Roo Code General Instructions

This is a godot game. My goal is to use a github user's profile (mine) and make a game from it.

## General Rules

- Important: When you edit a file, you should make ALL of your changes in one step rather than changing a line or section at a time. I will Reject consecutive edits to the same file.
- If needed, the godot binary is accessible at `/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`.

## MVP

- Load `data/repos.json` array to draw each repo as buildings or similar
  - Each repo has a `.languages` which is an object (`<LangName as string, Bytes as number>`). I want to use this so that the player has to gather the needed languages for each project
- From all of the repo's used languages, we should populate a different area of the map with each of those languages as a Mine
  - Player goes up to a mine and holds interact to gather bits/bytes
  - They return to projects and hold interact to deposit
  - A file `data/lang-colors.json` is available with colors for each possible language
- I'm thinking that to show progression to start, we can show a percentage of the overall progress
